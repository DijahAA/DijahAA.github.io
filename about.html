	Our Story
Established in 2019 from a small shed in Maitama Abuja, Ak APPARELS journey began when founder Khadija Almakura  set out to create a way for people to find the fashion they always wanted. Now the largest global fashion search platform AK APPARELS lets you search thousands of online fashion stores at once, bringing together 5 million products from 12,000 of the world’s leading brands and retailers in one place.<br><br><br>
<p>MISSION</p>
Our Mission
What if everything you love could be found through one, wide open door? AK APPAREL exists to make sure our customers can always find the fashion they want, something they truly love (even if they didn’t know they wanted it until they saw it). Khadija was inspired by the online tools that provide customers with transformational utility - products that are so useful that customers can’t live without them. The customer is at the centre of everything we do and we are continually innovating to provide them with even better ways to find the fashion that’s perfectly right for them. AK APPAREL exists to help you find your one in a million.<br><br><br>
